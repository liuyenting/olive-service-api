# OLIVE Service API

This document is based on the template project [restapidocs](https://github.com/jamescooke/restapidocs), which was taken from projects mainly using [Django Rest Framework](https://github.com/tomchristie/django-rest-framework).

Where full URLs are provided in reseponses, they are processed as if service is running on 'http://{ADDRESS}:{PORT}/'.

## Open endpoints

Open endpoints require no authentication.

## Endpoints that require authentication

Closed endpoints require a valid token to be included in the header of the request. A token can be acquired from the open endpoints above (FIXME to be updated).
